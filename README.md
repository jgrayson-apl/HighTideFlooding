# High Tide Flooding

### US High Tide Flooding Probability Scenarios Through 2100

High tide flooding today mostly affects low-lying and exposed assets or infrastructure, such as roads, harbors, beaches, public storm-, waste- and fresh-water systems and private and commercial properties.  Due to rising relative sea level (RSL), more and more cities are becoming increasingly exposed and evermore vulnerable to high tide flooding, which is rapidly increasing in frequency, depth and extent along many U.S. coastlines. Today, high tide flooding is likely more disruptive (a nuisance) than damaging. The cumulative effects, however, are becoming a serious problem in several locations including many with strategic importance to national security such as Norfolk, Virginia, San Diego, California and Kwajalein Island in the U.S. Marshall Islands.

The National Ocean Service (NOS) Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (COOPS) provides the National infrastructure, science, and technical expertise to collect and distribute observations and predictions of water levels and currents to ensure safe, efficient and environmentally sound maritime commerce. The Center provides the set of water level and tidal current products required to support NOS’ Strategic Plan mission requirements, and to assist in providing operational oceanographic data/products required by NOAA’s other Strategic Plan themes.

This information was obtained from *NOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 086*: [Patterns and Projections of High Tide Flooding Along the U.S. Coastline Using a Common Impact Threshold](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/publications/techrpt86_PaP_of_HTFlooding.pdf).
